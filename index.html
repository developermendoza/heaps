    <h1>Heaps</h1>
    <p>
      A heap is specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap
      property. In a heap, for every node 'i' other than the root:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If 'i' is a max-heap, the value of 'i' is greater than or equal to the
        values of its children
      </li>
      <li>
        If 'i' is a min-heap, the value of 'i' is less than or equal to the
        values of its childres.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, where elements with
      heigher priority (or lower priority, depending on the implementation) are
      served before elements with lower priority
    </p>

    <p>There are two main types of heaps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Max Heap: </b>The value of each node is greater than or equal to the
        values of its children.
      </li>
      <li>
        Min Heap: The value of each node is less than or equal to the values of
        its children.
      </li>
    </ol>
